# NullLights
 a plugin for my null hub project that can control wemo outlets

## python setup

python scripts are modified from [wemocontrol](https://github.com/ericpulvino/wemocontrol). which hasn't been updated for over 7 years.

### first try this

```bash
sudo apt-get install aptitude sudo aptitude install python-pip sudo python-pip install peewee
```

this version currently uses six.move import urllib....
```bash
sudo apt-get install six
```

had to do this to [install peewee](https://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/installation.html)

good luck.... it's probably going to be a mess to setup
